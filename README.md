# ✨ Lumi

**An AI-powered, Instagram-inspired social media app — built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase.**

</div>

---

## Overview

Lumi is a full-featured social media platform — feed, stories, reels, direct messages, notifications, and a profile system — with a set of AI-assisted moderation and content features layered on top. It's built as a single-page React app backed entirely by Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Row Level Security), with no separate backend server required.

## ✨ Features

**Core social experience**
- 🏠 **Home Feed** — image posts with likes, comments, and saves
- 📖 **Stories** — 24-hour ephemeral stories with audio and translation support
- 🎬 **Reels** — short-form video, stored via Supabase Storage
- 🧭 **Explore & Search** — content and people discovery
- 💬 **Direct Messages** — real-time conversations between users
- 🔔 **Notifications** — likes, comments, follows, and mentions
- 👤 **Profiles** — editable profiles with follower/following counts, verified badges, and an owner tag

**AI-assisted layer**
- 🤖 AI caption generation and summarization
- ✅ AI fact-checking of post captions (verified / suspicious / likely false)
- 🚫 Explicit content detection
- 🎭 Mood-based content filtering

**Safety & control**
- 🔒 Row Level Security on every table — users only touch their own data
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Lock — password-protected content filtering and DM blocking for younger users
- 🚩 Reporting system for posts and users
- 🔗 Referral system with unique codes

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Lumi's Supabase schema includes 17 tables covering the full app surface:

`profiles` · `posts` · `stories` · `reels` · `comments` · `likes` · `saves` · `follows` · `conversations` · `messages` · `notifications` · `reports` · `trending_audio` · `referrals` · `user_settings` · `ai_results` · `explicit_content_flags` · `parental_controls`

Every table has Row Level Security enabled, with authenticated-only access and ownership-scoped mutations — public reads are limited to what's needed for explore/search to work.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Lumi-2211-main
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 3. Run database migrations

Apply the SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` to your Supabase project, in order, via the Supabase SQL editor or CLI:

```bash
supabase db push
```

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
